1. main.py: This is the entry point for the InvestNow application. It handles the primary operations such as logging in, registering, and quitting the application. The main() function manages the user interaction loop, creating instances of the Login, Register, and Session classes. It allows the user to choose to login, register, or quit the application.

2. register.py: This module provides the Register class, which is responsible for registering new users to the InvestNow application. It prompts the user for their registration credentials and saves the new user data to a JSON file. It also includes verification checks to ensure that a username does not already exist in the system, and prompts for the username, password, and email of the new user.

3. session.py: The Session class represents a user session within the InvestNow application. It is used to store the username of the currently logged-in user. The session object maintains the user's state across different parts of the application after they log in.

4. login.py: This module provides the Login class, which is responsible for handling user logins. It prompts the user for their credentials and verifies them against the stored user data in a JSON file. If the login is successful, it gives the user access to their profile, portfolio analysis, and trading algorithm options. It also provides options for retrying in case of incorrect inputs, returning to the main menu, or quitting the application.

5. my_profile.py: The MyProfile class in this module manages user profile operations in the InvestNow application. The class initializes by loading user data from a JSON file. It provides functionality to view the user profile and update various aspects of it such as email, password, age, and risk tolerance. It includes various input prompt methods that interactively ask for user input. The updated user data is saved back to the JSON file.

6. portfolio_analysis.py: The PortfolioAnalysis class allows users to manage and analyze their stock portfolios. Users can view their stocks, add new stock holdings, or remove existing ones. The data is loaded from a JSON file and the changes are saved back to it. The module utilizes the prettytable library to create a visually appealing table to display the stock holdings. It also provides a method for continuing or quitting the portfolio operations.

7. trading_algorithm.py: The TradingAlgorithm class in this module provides advanced portfolio management features. Users can view their Minimum Variance Portfolio (MVP) and Maximum Sharpe Ratio Portfolio (MSR) as well as perform automated optimization to adjust their current portfolio to either the MVP or MSR. The module also allows users to visualize the Efficient Frontier of their portfolio and a Correlation Matrix of their stocks' returns. Furthermore, users can adjust their analysis' time horizon. The calculations are based on historical stock prices fetched from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance library. The module uses pandas, numpy, and scipy for data manipulation and optimization tasks, and matplotlib and seaborn for visualizations.
